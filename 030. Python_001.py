# Python是一种易于学习又功能强大的编程语言。
# 它提供了高效的高级数据结构，还有简单有效的面向对象编程。
# Python优雅的语法和动态类型，以及解释型语言的本质，使它成为多数平台上写脚本和快速开发应用的理想语言。

import this # Zen of Python(Python之禅)，列出Python设计的原则与哲学，有助于理解与使用这种语言

# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
